# pyqt-watermark-applier
PyQt app which can add watermark in multiple images at once

## How to Use
After selecting the watermark image file you want, you can apply the watermark to all images in the chosen folder. The watermark can be set for resizing, margins, position, tiling, and opacity. When the program closes, you will be prompted to decide whether to run it in the background. If it takes a long time, running it in the background might be a good option.

Compare image files in "sample" folder and those in "result" folder.
